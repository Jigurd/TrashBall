How to use the app
- Make a tossing motion with your arm to throw the phone. The app does not care what direction you throw your phone, it just records the raw acceleration speed.

Extra Features
- You can set a nickname in the preferences.
- There is a high scores table which records your nickname, the height of your throw, the airtime of the ball, and the time the throw was made.
- Technically outside of spec: the phone buzzes when the ball reaches peak height as well.

Changes made as part of testing
- The text of the throw changes to "Throwing..." during a throw, as tester found it confusing and frustrating that the app just froze during a throw.
